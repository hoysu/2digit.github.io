    <li><strong>Automated analysis features</strong> that quickly analyze vast amounts of data and provide insights, reducing data interpretation time.</li>
    <li>The ability to <strong>improve prediction accuracy</strong> by performing more precise analysis compared to traditional statistical prediction models.</li>
    <li><strong>User-friendly interfaces</strong> based on natural language processing analysis, making it accessible for non-experts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Role of Generative AI in the Financial Market</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market is one of the most volatile financial markets, where precise predictions through data analysis are essential.
